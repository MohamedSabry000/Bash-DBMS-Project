Drydn makes vacuum cleaners
input => row materials: steel, plastic, and some of other **components** needed for the product. 

* these components are made by other companies

=> the other roles needed are: 
* labour (worker and managers)  
* capital (money)
* knowledge is important for keeping **Drydn company image**

* Drydn has goods **worth** millions of dollars 
in its (factory, warehouses which contains *finished products*, materials and components)

* row mterials, components, work-in-progress, finished goods are **stocks** المخزونات نفسها

==> Drydn has about 20 company as a prtner or supplier
==> the company makes some *subcontracting* for material helpers, actually it's **outsourcing** more


all of this takes money:
* keep components, and goods **in stocks**

stocks have to be 
finished ( which paid )
, stored ( which in warehouses ), 
and handled  which (move from one place to another)

so **suppliers** must provide components *just in time*

this is part of **lean production** or **lean manufactoring** , 
making things efficiently ( which doing things as quickly and cheaply as possible without waster )
